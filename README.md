# ESP8266HomekitThermostat

This project is used to modify the "Eqiva Thermostat Model N, 132231K0A" to enable Apple Homekit using an ESP8266-01.
The source code is based on Mixiaoxio Arduino-HomeKit-ESP8266 project (see https://github.com/Mixiaoxiao/Arduino-HomeKit-ESP8266).

The project includes the following parts:
  - ESP8266 source code
  - 3d model to interate the ESP into the thermostat (not perfect but works)
